### Planning
Base line of the project will be to create columns, to add tasks that can be drag and dropped.  
If I have more time I will implement a search functionality, add color options to tasks/columns, and posisibly have text markdown usage (react-quill)

### User Story
- A user can create columns giving them a titled category such as "To work on", "Completed", "Stage 1", etc.
- A user can create tasks in any column.
- A user can drag and drop tasks into other columns.
- A user can delete a task/column.
- A user can edit a task/column.

### Dependencies
- react-spring
- @material-ui/core
